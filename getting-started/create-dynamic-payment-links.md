# Dynamic Payment Links \(Cheatsheet\)

## What are Dynamic Payment Links?

In our Dashboard, you can create payment links, but with your own personal payment page, you can create payment requests without creating, just via a custom URL.

Save time with creating payment links, just use dynamic links like: payrequest.me/name/12,50 or even payrequest.me/12,50/title/email

### Examples Dynamic Payment Links

| Link | Information |
| :--- | :--- |
| payrequest.me/name | This is your payment page, for example: payrequest.me/hostingwalk |
| payrequest.me/name/5,50 | Amount \(will use default currency\) |
| payrequest.me/name/USD/5,50 | Amount \(and USD currency\) can be changed to any currency like EUR(euro) or PND(Pound). |
| payrequest.me/pay/name/creditcard/5,99 | Payment method Credit Card & amount of 5,99 ( don't miss the pay thats in front! ) |
