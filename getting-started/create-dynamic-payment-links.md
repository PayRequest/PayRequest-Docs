# Dynamic Payment Links \(Cheatsheet\)

## What are Dynamic Payment Links?

In our Dashboard, you can create payment links, but with your own personal payment page, you can create payment requests without creating, just via a custom URL.

Save time with creating payment links, just use dynamic links like: payrequest.me/name/12,50 or even payrequest.me/12,50/title/email

### Examples Dynamic Payment Links

| Link | Information |
| :--- | :--- |
| payrequest.me/name | This is your payment page, for example: payrequest.me/hostingwalk |
| payrequest.me/name/5,50 | with an amount \(will use default currency\) |
| payrequest.me/name/USD/5,50 | with an amount \(and USD currency\) can be changed to any currency like EURO or POUND. |
| payrequest.me/name/5,50/invoice-3494 | with an amount & custom title, can be changed to whatever. |
| payrequest.me/name/EUR/5,40/invoice-534/customer@mail.com | with an amount & custom title & currency EURO & e-mail of a customer. |
